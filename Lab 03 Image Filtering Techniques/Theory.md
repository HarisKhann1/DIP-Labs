### Image Filtering

Image filtering is a technique used in image processing to enhance, transform, or extract information from images by applying various filters. Common types of filters include mean, median, Gaussian, and Sobel, each serving different purposes such as noise reduction, smoothing, and edge detection.

### Mean Filter:

Averages the pixel values in a neighborhood to reduce noise and smooth the image.

### Median Filter:

Replaces each pixel value with the median value of the neighboring pixels, effectively removing salt-and-pepper noise.

### Gaussian Filter:

Applies a Gaussian function to blur the image, reducing detail and noise while maintaining edge integrity.

### Sobel Filter:

Computes the gradient of the image intensity to detect edges, highlighting regions with high spatial frequency changes.
