# Lab 1: Introduction to DIP

Digital Image Processing (DIP) involves the manipulation and analysis of digital images using algorithms and computational techniques. It aims to enhance, restore, and extract useful information from images.

**Importance and Applications of DIP
Medical Imaging:** Enhancing and analyzing images from MRI, CT scans, and X-rays for diagnostic purposes.

**Remote Sensing:** Processing satellite and aerial imagery for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and resource management.

**Forensics:** Enhancing images and videos for criminal investigations and evidence analysis.

**Industrial Inspection:** Automated quality control by analyzing product images for defects.

**Entertainment:** Image editing, video processing, and special effects in movies and games.

**Robotics and Automation**: Object recognition and navigation for autonomous systems.
Basic Concepts

### Image:

A representation of a visual scene in a digital format, typically as a 2D array of pixels.

### Pixel:

The smallest unit of a digital image, holding an intensity value for grayscale images or color values for color images.

### Resolution:

The detail an image holds, defined by the number of pixels in width and height (e.g., 1920x1080).

### Grayscale:

An image composed of varying shades of gray, where each pixel represents an intensity value between black and white.

### Color Models:

Mathematical models describing the representation of colors. Common models include:

### RGB (Red, Green, Blue):

A color model in which colors are described by their red, green, and blue components.
